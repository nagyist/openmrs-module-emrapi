# Functionality

## Inpatient care, ADT, and dispositions

The emrapi module provides an API for defining patient dispositions and ADT workflows and tracking.
In order to configure one's system to utilize the EMR API functionality as expected, the following is required:

### Admissions, Discharges, and Transfers

All ADT events are modeled as encounters of specific types.  These must be configured using the metadata mapping module as follows:

| Mapping Source             | Mapping Code                            | Metadata Class            |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| org.openmrs.module.emrapi  | emr.admissionEncounterType              | org.openmrs.EncounterType |
| org.openmrs.module.emrapi  | emr.transferWithinHospitalEncounterType | org.openmrs.EncounterType |
| org.openmrs.module.emrapi  | emr.exitFromInpatientEncounterType      | org.openmrs.EncounterType |

### Dispositions

The EMR API module supports _requests_ for admission, discharge, and transfer via a specific set of "disposition" observations.
One must set up and add EMR API mappings to concepts in their system to indicate which concepts should represent specific dispositions.
These include:

| Concept Source Name       | Concept Term Name          | Concept Class | Concept Datatype |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| org.openmrs.module.emrapi | Disposition Concept Set    | ConvSet       | N/A              |
| org.openmrs.module.emrapi | Disposition                | Question      | Coded            |
| org.openmrs.module.emrapi | Admission Location         | Question      | Text             |
| org.openmrs.module.emrapi | Internal Transfer Location | Question      | Text             |
| org.openmrs.module.emrapi | Date of Death              | Question      | Date             |

* The `Disposition Concept Set` should contain the other concepts above as set members
* The `Disposition` concept should contain concepts for the specific dispositions supported.  These concepts do not need any specific mappings, 
  but will be configured within the `Disposition Config`, described below.  Typical examples of concepts to include are:
  * `Admit to Hospital -> Misc; N/A`
  * `Internal Transfer -> Misc; N/A`
  * `Discharge from Hospital -> Misc; N/A`
* The `Admission Location`, `Internal Transfer Location`, and `Date of Death` concepts represent additional observations typically collected within
  the same obs group as the disposition, in order to collect associated information related to the chosen disposition.

Once disposition concepts are configured, one needs to create a `Disposition Config`.  This is a json file which communicates with the EMR API
module to indicate which dispositions are available in the system, what associated questions/observations are collected for each, and
what type of ADT action is each associated with.  There are typically 2 main ways of setting the disposition config:

* Programmatically calling `dispositionService.setDispositionConfig(String path)`, where path is something like 
  `file:configuration/pih/pih-dispositions-haiti.json`
* Using initializer to load the disposition config, by placing a single json file (with any name) under `.OpenMRS/configuration/dispositions` 

The disposition json file is expected to contain an array of dispositions at the top level.  Each disposition is an object with the following attributes:

* `uuid`: This does not need to be an actual uuid, it is just a unique key/identifier for this particular disposition
* `name`: Typically a message code for how you want this disposition to appear in the UI
* `conceptCode`: A concept uuid or source:mapping reference to the specific concept representing this disposition.  This will be the `valueCoded` of the disposition when selected.
* `type`: (optional, one of ADMIT, TRANSFER, DISCHARGE).  This is what communicates to the EMR API module whether this disposition should represent an ADT request.
* `encounterTypes`: (optional array of uuids).  If specified, this will indicate that this disposition should only be collected in encounters of the given types.
* `excludedEncounterTypes`: (optional array of uuids).  If specified, this will indicate that this disposition should not be collected in encounters of the given types.
* `actions`: (optional array of component names).  If specified, this indicates which Spring components that implement the `DispositionAction` interface should be executed when this disposition is saved
* `additionalObs`: (optional array of objects). If specified, this is means to communicate to the UI what additional observations should be collected with a disposition

Please see the following examples:

* [A relatively simple example](https://github.com/PIH/openmrs-distro-rwandaemr/blob/402a839be5caed9788851e742d95233549f601ee/rwandaemr-content/backend_configuration/dispositions/dispositionConfig.json)
* [A more complex example](https://github.com/PIH/openmrs-config-zl/blob/803e0cb09b4b782402ece3f01fe6d6b1d5655357/configuration/pih/pih-dispositions-haiti-inpatient.json)

### Admission Decisions

In order to account for circumstances where a request for Admission, Discharge, or Transfer was initiated via a disposition, but the subsequent
Admission, Discharge, or Transfer encounter is not able to take place, one needs to configure and use an `Admission Decision` obs to indicate this.

The configuration needed to set this up would be to map 2 concepts as follows:

| Concept Source Name       | Concept Term Name  | Concept Class | Concept Datatype |
|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------|------------------|
| org.openmrs.module.emrapi | Admission Decision | Question      | Coded            |
| org.openmrs.module.emrapi | Deny Admission     | Misc          | N/A              |

* The `Deny Admission` concept should be added as an answer to the `Admission Decision` question
